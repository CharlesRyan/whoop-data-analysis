# Whoop Data Analysis

Uses Nuxt.js, Vue.js, c3.js, and d3.js to create visualizations of raw data generated by the Whoop Strap fitness/sleep tracker

Currently just charts data points' relationship to their average for each day

Future features will include more interactivity (control which data types appear) and integration with a habit tracking app
